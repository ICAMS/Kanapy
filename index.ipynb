    "polycrystalline microstructures. The microstructures are built based on statistical information about grain geometry, given as grain size distribution and aspect ratio of grains, and crystallographic texture, in form of orientation distribution functions (ODF) and misorientation distribution functions (MDF). Kanapy offers tools to analyze EBSD maps with respect to the geometry and texture of microstructures. Based on this experimental data, it generates 3D synthetic microstructures mimicking real ones in a statistical sense. The [online documentation](https://icams.github.io/Kanapy/) of Kanapy for more information. \n",
